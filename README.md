# Mapty-App
 
Mapty is a workout logging application that uses the Leaflet API to allow users to track their workouts on a map. It was created as a part of the "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" course by Jonas Schmedtmann. The source code for the application can be found on GitHub.

## Installation and Usage
To use Mapty, you will need to clone or download the repository from GitHub onto your local machine. Once you have downloaded the repository, open the index.html file in your browser to start the application.

## Functionality
Mapty allows users to track their workouts on a map by adding markers to the map for each workout. Users can choose between two types of workouts: running and cycling. For each workout, users can enter the following information:

Type of workout (running or cycling)
Distance (in km or miles)
Duration (in minutes)
Elevation gain (in meters or feet)
Location (latitude and longitude)
The application uses the Geolocation API to determine the user's current location and center the map around that location. Users can also search for a specific location using the search bar.

In addition to tracking workouts, Mapty also allows users to save their workouts to local storage and retrieve them later. Users can also delete individual workouts or all workouts at once.
